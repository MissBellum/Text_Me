# ðŸ“± TextMe
Welcome to TextMe! ðŸ‘‹ This is a simple, Django-based chatbot app thatâ€™s still in development. The goal is to create a fun, interactive chat experience powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini API to keep conversations flowing smoothly.

Right now, TextMe is in its early stages, so things are a little basic, and you may run into some unfinished featuresâ€”but thatâ€™s all part of the journey.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
TextMe aims to bring real-time chat to life using Django on the backend, AJAX for instant message updates, and a liddol of JavaScript to make everything feel smooth and snappy.

## Current Features
- Chat with an AI Bot: Send messages and get responses in real-time.
- Powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini API: All responses are generated by Googleâ€™s Gemini, adding a smart and engaging touch to conversations.
- AJAX Updates: No need to refreshâ€”messages will appear instantly in the chat window.
- Simple UI: The interface is still in progress, but it's getting there!
